   - Open `configs/config.py` to understand the configuration settings used throughout the project.

2. **Understand Data Loading**:
   - Review `data/my_bio_dataset.py` to see how datasets are defined and loaded.
   - Check `factory/bio_data_factory.py` to understand how data loaders are created.

3. **Explore Model Training**:
   - Look at `train.py` to see the main training loop and how the model is trained.
   - Review `step.py` to understand how predictions are made during training.

4. **Check Model Evaluation**:
   - Open `eval.py` to see how the model is evaluated after training.

### How to Run the Project
1. **Install Dependencies**:
   Ensure you have all the required dependencies installed. You can usually find these in a `requirements.txt` file or by examining the import statements in the code.

   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Prepare the Dataset**:
   Ensure your dataset is in the correct format and location as expected by the data loading scripts. Update the paths in the configuration file if necessary.

3. **Train the Model**:
   Run the training script to start training the model.

   ```sh
   python train.py
   ```

4. **Evaluate the Model**:
   After training, run the evaluation script to test the model.

   ```sh
   python eval.py
   ```

### Testing the Project
To test the project, you can write unit tests for individual components like data loading, model training, and evaluation. Place your test scripts in a `tests/` directory and use a testing framework like `pytest`.

```sh
pytest tests/
```

- 1 epoch for whole sample to complete one whole cycle.
- 1 iteration for a batch of the sample (this batch could either be the whole sample or the sample divided into parts) to complete one cycle
- you could say 'n' batches take 'n' iterations.

Loss functions are mathematical functions that measure how well a machine learning model’s predictions match the actual data labels. In other words, they quantify the "error" or "difference" between the model's predictions and the true values, providing a feedback signal that the model can use to adjust its parameters during training.

How Loss Functions Work in Training
Forward Pass: During training, the model makes predictions on a batch of data and calculates the loss by comparing its predictions to the true values using the loss function.
Backpropagation: The loss value is then used in backpropagation to compute gradients (how much each model parameter should change to reduce the loss).
Parameter Update: The optimizer updates the model’s parameters in the direction that minimizes the loss, helping the model improve its predictions.

Types of Loss Functions
Different types of loss functions are used based on the type of problem (e.g., classification, regression, or other tasks like segmentation):

1. For Classification (e.g., predicting labels like "cat" or "dog")
Binary Cross-Entropy (BCE): Commonly used for binary classification (e.g., "yes" or "no" tasks). It penalizes incorrect predictions more as the model's confidence grows, encouraging the model to make better predictions.

2. For Image Segmentation (e.g., predicting boundaries of objects in images)
Binary Cross-Entropy (BCE): Also used in segmentation when the task involves classifying each pixel as either belonging to an object or the background.

In the segmentation setting of a loss function, "dice" refers to the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) or Dice Score, which is a metric commonly used in image segmentation tasks to measure the overlap between the predicted segmentation and the ground truth segmentation.

What is the Dice Similarity Coefficient?
The Dice Similarity Coefficient is a statistical measure that quantifies the similarity between two sets. In the context of image segmentation:

It compares the pixels in the predicted segmentation mask (the model's output) with the actual ground truth mask.
The value of the Dice coefficient ranges from 0 to 1, where:
1 indicates a perfect overlap (the prediction exactly matches the ground truth).
0 indicates no overlap at all.

Dice Loss in Segmentation
The Dice Loss is derived from the Dice coefficient, designed to be minimized (lower loss values indicate better overlap). It’s often calculated as:

Dice Loss=1−Dice

Using Dice Loss as part of the segmentation loss function encourages the model to maximize the overlap between the predicted and true segmentation regions, improving performance on segmentation tasks.

Why Use Dice Loss?
Dice Loss is especially useful in imbalanced datasets, where the foreground object (e.g., a small tumor in a medical image) occupies only a small fraction of the image. In these cases, traditional losses like Binary Cross-Entropy may be less effective, as they don't specifically focus on the overlap. Dice Loss, however, directly rewards overlap, making it particularly valuable in pixel-level segmentation tasks.
